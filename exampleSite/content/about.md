As a data engineer with over four years of experience in the field, I have developed a wide range of skills and expertise in various technologies such as Python, AWS, Airflow, Scala, Spark, and Databricks. During my career, I had the opportunity to lead a team of Data Engineers that supported business operations across four countries, which allowed me to develop my leadership and collaboration skills. Additionally, I was the lead on a successful Data Migration/Sync project, managing over 4 TB of data.

Whether you are looking to build a data infrastructure from scratch, optimize your data pipelines, or implement cutting-edge data technologies, I am here to help you meet your data engineering needs. Don't hesitate to get in touch, and let's explore how we can work together to achieve your goals..
